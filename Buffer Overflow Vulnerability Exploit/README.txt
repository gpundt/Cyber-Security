This folder contains scripts and the server source code which contains the buffer overflow vulnerability.

The python scripts allow me to fuzz the server and find where the buffer overflow occurs.
The exploit python script allows me to exploit the server using a reverse TCP connection, giving me access to the device running the server with elevated priveleges.
