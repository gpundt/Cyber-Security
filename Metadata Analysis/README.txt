This script will allow an individual to download files from the internet and analyze them using ExifTool, the metadata reading, wrtiting, and editing tool.

I was tasked with performing a metadata analysis on a company's public-facing online documents; this script I created allowed me to automate the process, making it much
easier and more structured. I curated this script for my personal needs, however, it is highly customizable; can be modified for extra functionality.
